** SHA1-Password-Exploitation**

## Overview
This repository contains code for exploiting SHA-1 hashed passwords through brute force. SHA-1, once considered secure, has been found to have vulnerabilities due to collision exploits discovered by researchers. Despite its deprecated status, SHA-1 remains relevant for historical and compatibility reasons, such as password hashing and document verification.

## Contents
- `main.py`: Python script for brute forcing SHA-1 hashed passwords.
- `passwords.txt`: Sample file containing a list of passwords to test against.

## Usage
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rishi-kaul/SHA1-Password-Exploitation.git
    ```

2. **Run Script**: Execute the Python script `main.py` by providing the SHA-1 hash to crack as input. For example:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Input SHA-1 Hash**: Enter the SHA-1 hash you want to crack when prompted.

4. **Wait for Results**: The script will iterate through the passwords listed in `passwords.txt` and compare their SHA-1 hashes with the provided input hash. If a match is found, the corresponding password will be displayed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- hashlib library

## Note
This code is provided for educational purposes only. It demonstrates the weakness of SHA-1 in password hashing and should not be used for any malicious activities. It's essential to use secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt for password storage and authentication.

## Disclaimer
The exploitation of passwords without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have the necessary permissions before using this code on any system or network. This repository and its contributors are not liable for any misuse or damage caused by the utilization of this code.
